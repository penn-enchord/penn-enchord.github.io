In spring 2015 he joined this badass Chinese-Western a capella as a Bass and met his fellow EnChorders. Zifan has a low and somewhat husky voice; while described by some as “sexy”, he thinks it is his way of expressing masculinity through singing. Names on his playlists include Lil Wayne, Leonard Cohen, Toni Braxton and Li Zhi. When not singing, he enjoys cycling and playing pool. Elected as the future President of Penn EnChord, he takes this hand-over as both a challenge and an incentive.</p>
